I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of [Prof. Rajeev Alur](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/) and [Prof. Eric Wong](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~exwong/).
This fall, I'll be starting my postdoc at the [UT Austin Center for Generative AI](https://ml.utexas.edu/center-for-generative-ai).


My goal is to make ML systems safe and interpretable using formal methods, control theory, and optimization!
I am broadly interested in:
- Making LLMs better at **logical reasoning**
- Training models that are **interpretable** by design
- Developing simple yet useful **explainability** techniques
- Establishing **formal guarantees** for ML systems
- **Linear algebra** and big matrices
