I am a final year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania advised by [Prof. Rajeev Alur](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/) and [Prof. Eric Wong](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~exwong/).
This fall, I'll be starting my postdoc at [UT Austin's Center for Generative AI](https://ml.utexas.edu/center-for-generative-ai), hosted by [Prof. Adam Klivans](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~klivans/).


My goal is to make ML systems safe and interpretable using formal methods, control theory, and optimization!
I am broadly interested in:
- Making LLMs better at **logical reasoning**
- Training models that are **interpretable** by design
- Developing simple yet useful **explainability** techniques
- Establishing **formal guarantees** for ML systems
- **Linear algebra** and big matrices
