I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student studying Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania.
I am advised by [Prof. Rajeev Alur](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/) and [Prof. Eric Wong](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~exwong/).
I am broadly interested in:
- Explainable Machine Learning
- Formal Methods
- Dynamical Systems and Control
- Applied Optimization
